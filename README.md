Todo:

just implement a lookup table when saving as duckypad 2020, discard extra column of keys and rotary encoders, and map the key numbers?

or, in DP20 firmware to translate DPP numbers to DP numbers, dont mess around with configurator?

when pressing save on local dir, ask what duckypad is it for?

implement dir create delete and file write HID commands on DP evo

implement profile format conversion on DPP firmware

done:

start working from connect_button_click()
open_click: set global variable of current duckypad type (og or pro)
